""".....OOPs......"""
#   - OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming


"""......Class......"""
#   - A class is a blueprint or template to create objects.

#.....Example.....

# Think of a class like:
#   • A design
#   • A plan
#   • A template
#  - It does not hold real data until an object is created.


#.....Example :  

# class Factory:
#     a = 12  #attribute 
#     def hello():   #method 
#         print("how are you")


# print(Factory.a)
# Factory.hello()


# Class     : To make a class you can just use the class keyword
# Attribute : A variable stored inside a class is Attribute.
# Method    : A function stored inside a class is Method.

# (Note : To call the Attribute or Method you have to first call the class
#         then you can call specific attribute or method.)


"""......Object......"""
#   - An object is an actual instance of a class.
#   - It is created from a class and stores real data.

#....Example (Object Creation):

class Student:
    pass

s1 = Student()  
s2 = Student()

# Student() → creates an object
# s1, s2 → different objects
