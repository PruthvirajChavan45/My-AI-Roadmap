# 📘 Excel – Phase 6 | Day 2  

## 📌 Topic: Data Entry Techniques & Worksheet Management  

Today I learned important Excel features that help improve **speed, accuracy, and efficiency** while working with spreadsheets. These concepts are essential for handling large datasets and maintaining clean, structured Excel files.

## 🔹 Fill Techniques  

Fill techniques help copy data, formulas, or patterns quickly.

Covered:
- Fill handle for copying values and formulas  
- Auto-fill series (numbers, dates, days, months)  
- Drag to extend patterns automatically  

These techniques reduce manual work and save time.

## 🔹 Cell Reference Technique  

Cell references control how formulas behave when copied.

### Types of Cell References:
- **Relative Reference (A1)** → changes automatically  
- **Absolute Reference ($A$1)** → remains fixed  
- **Mixed Reference ($A1 / A$1)** → partially fixed  

Used to ensure correct formula calculations.

## 🔹 Intelligent Navigation  

Smart navigation helps move quickly in large worksheets.

- `Ctrl + Arrow Keys` → jump to data boundaries  
- `Ctrl + Shift + Arrow` → select large data ranges  
- `Ctrl + Home` → move to first cell  
- `Ctrl + End` → move to last used cell  

Improves productivity while analyzing data.

## 🔹 Freeze Panes  

Freeze panes keep important rows or columns visible while scrolling.

Used for:
- Freezing header rows  
- Locking key identifier columns  

Helps maintain context in large datasets.

---

## 🔹 Split View  

Split divides the worksheet window into multiple panes.

Benefits:
- View different parts of the same worksheet simultaneously  
- Compare distant sections of data  

---

## 🔹 Zoom  

Zoom controls the worksheet view.

- Zoom in for detailed editing  
- Zoom out for full-sheet overview  

Useful during data review and presentations.

---

## 🔹 Data Validation  

Data validation restricts incorrect data entry.

Used to:
- Allow only specific values  
- Set numeric or date limits  
- Maintain data consistency  

Improves data quality.

---

## 🔹 Dropdown Lists  

Dropdowns are created using data validation.

Used for:
- Selecting predefined values  
- Reducing manual typing errors  
- Standardizing input values  

Common examples:
- Status (Yes/No)  
- Department names  
- Categories
