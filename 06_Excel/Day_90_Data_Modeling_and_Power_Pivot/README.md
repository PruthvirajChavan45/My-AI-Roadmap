# 📘 Excel – Phase 6 | Day 15  

## 📌 Topic: Merge & Append, Power Pivot & Data Modeling Concepts  

On Day 15, I explored **advanced data modeling features in Excel** using Power Query and Power Pivot. These tools are essential for handling **multiple tables, large datasets, and relational data analysis**, similar to database systems like SQL or BI tools.

This session focused on combining datasets and understanding relationships between tables.

## 🔹 Merge (Power Query)

**Merge** is used to combine two tables based on a common key column (similar to SQL JOIN).

Used when:
- Adding extra columns from another table  
- Matching records between datasets  

### Types of Merge (Joins)
- Inner  
- Left Outer  
- Right Outer  
- Full Outer  

Example use cases:
- Students + Marks  
- Orders + Customer details  
- Sales + Product info  

✔ Works like database joins  
✔ Combines related information  

---

## 🔹 Append (Power Query)

**Append** is used to stack tables vertically (row-wise).

Used when:
- Same structure tables  
- Monthly or yearly files  
- Combining multiple datasets  

Example:
- January + February + March sales  

✔ Increases rows  
✔ Schema must match

## 🔹 Power Pivot  

Power Pivot is used for **advanced data modeling and analysis** inside Excel.

Features:
- Handle millions of rows  
- Create relationships between tables  
- Build calculated columns  
- Create measures (DAX formulas)  
- Works with Pivot Tables  

Used for:
- Large-scale analysis  
- Business Intelligence reports  
- Dashboard creation

## 🔹 Cardinality  

Cardinality defines the **relationship type between tables**.

### Types:
- One-to-One (1:1)  
- One-to-Many (1:M) ← most common  
- Many-to-Many (M:M)  

Example:
- One Customer → Many Orders  

Helps ensure correct data linking.

## 🔹 Active & Inactive Relationships  

### Active Relationship
- Default relationship  
- Used automatically in analysis  

### Inactive Relationship
- Exists but not used by default  
- Activated manually when needed  

Used when:
- Multiple relationships between same tables  
- Different analysis scenarios
