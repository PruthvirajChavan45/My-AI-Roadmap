# 📘 Excel – Phase 6 | Day 16  

## 📌 Topic: Introduction to DAX & Data Modeling with Power Pivot  

On Day 16, I started learning **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** in Excel using **Power Pivot**. DAX is a powerful formula language used for **advanced calculations, data modeling, and business intelligence reporting**.

This marks the transition from **basic Excel formulas → professional BI-level analysis**.

## 🔹 What is DAX?

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is used to:
- Create calculated columns  
- Create measures  
- Perform aggregations  
- Build advanced reports and dashboards  

It is commonly used in:
- Power Pivot  
- Power BI  
- Excel Data Models  

Benefits:
- Handles large datasets  
- Faster calculations  
- More powerful than regular Excel formulas  

---

## 🔹 Getting Started with DAX  

Learned how to:
- Enable Power Pivot  
- Load tables into Data Model  
- Write DAX formulas inside Power Pivot  

Basic DAX formula example:
```
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
```

Works similarly to Excel but uses **table[column] syntax**.

## 🔹 Making Relationships  

Created relationships between tables in the Data Model.

Steps:
- Connect tables using common keys  
- Define primary and foreign keys  
- Build One-to-Many relationships  

Example:
- Customers → Orders  
- Products → Sales  

Used to:
- Analyze data across multiple tables  
- Perform relational calculations  

---

## 🔹 Calculated Columns (Calc-Col)  

Calculated columns compute values **row by row**.

Example:
```
Profit = Sales[Revenue] - Sales[Cost]
```

Used for:
- Row-level logic  
- Derived fields  
- Data transformation  

Difference:
- Calculated Column → row-wise  
- Measure → aggregation  

---

## 🔹 Text Functions in DAX  

Learned basic text manipulation using DAX functions.

Examples:
```
UPPER()
LOWER()
LEFT()
RIGHT()
MID()
LEN()
CONCATENATE()
```

Used for:
- Cleaning text  
- Formatting data  
- Creating labels
