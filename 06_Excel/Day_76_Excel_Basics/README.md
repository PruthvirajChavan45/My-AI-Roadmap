Today I started **Phase 6: Microsoft Excel**, focusing on understanding the core building blocks of Excel. These fundamentals are essential for data handling, reporting, and analysis in real-world business and data-related roles.

## 🔹 What is a Workbook?

A **Workbook** is the main Excel file.  
It can contain:
- One or more worksheets  
- Data tables  
- Charts  
- Formulas  

Example:  
`Student_Data.xlsx` → this is a workbook.

## 🔹 What is a Worksheet?

A **Worksheet** is a single sheet inside a workbook where data is entered and analyzed.

- Each workbook can have multiple worksheets  
- Worksheets are made up of rows and columns  

---

## 🔹 Rows and Columns  

- **Rows** → Horizontal (1, 2, 3, …)  
- **Columns** → Vertical (A, B, C, …)  

### Operations Learned
- Selecting rows and columns  
- Adding new rows and columns  
- Deleting rows and columns  

These operations help organize and restructure data efficiently.

## 🔹 Cell Format  

Cell formatting is used to improve data readability and presentation.

Covered:
- Font style and size  
- Bold, italic, underline  
- Cell alignment  
- Background color  
- Borders  

Formatting helps make reports clean and professional.

## 🔹 Number Formats  

Excel allows data to be displayed in different number formats:

- General  
- Number  
- Currency  
- Percentage  
- Date  
- Time  

Number formatting changes **how data appears**, not the actual value.

---

## 🔹 Custom Number Formats  

Custom formats allow displaying numbers in a specific way.

Examples:
- Showing currency symbols  
- Adding text with numbers  
- Controlling decimal places  

Useful for financial and business reports.

## 🔹 Formulas in Excel  

Formulas always start with `=` and are used to perform calculations.

Example:
```
= A1 + B1
```

Formulas automatically update when data changes.

## 🔹 Basic Excel Functions  

Learned commonly used basic functions:

- `SUM()` → adds values  
- `AVERAGE()` → calculates mean  
- `COUNT()` → counts numeric cells  
- `MAX()` → finds highest value  
- `MIN()` → finds lowest value  

These functions form the foundation of Excel analysis.
