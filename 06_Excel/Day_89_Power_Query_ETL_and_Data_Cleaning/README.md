# 📘 Excel – Phase 6 | Day 14  

## 📌 Topic: Power Query, Data Import & Data Transformation  

On Day 14, I learned **Power Query**, one of the most powerful tools in Excel for **data cleaning, transformation, and automation**. Power Query is widely used in real-world data analysis and business intelligence workflows to handle messy and large datasets efficiently.

This session focused on **importing data and transforming it without manual formulas**.

## 🔹 What is Power Query?

Power Query is an Excel tool used for:
- Importing data from multiple sources  
- Cleaning and transforming data  
- Automating repetitive tasks  
- Preparing data for analysis  

It follows the concept:
**Extract → Transform → Load (ETL)**

Benefits:
- No complex formulas needed  
- Repeatable steps  
- Handles large datasets efficiently

## 🔹 Power Query (From Folder)

Learned how to import **multiple files at once** using the folder option.

Steps:
1. Data → Get Data → From Folder  
2. Select folder containing multiple files  
3. Combine and transform automatically  

Used for:
- Monthly reports  
- Multiple CSV/Excel files  
- Batch processing  

This saves significant manual effort.

## 🔹 Pivot in Power Query  

Pivot converts **rows into columns**.

Example:
- Category-wise data converted into separate columns  

Used for:
- Summary reports  
- Cross-tab style tables  
- Dashboard-ready data

## 🔹 Unpivot in Power Query  

Unpivot converts **columns into rows**.

Example:
- Monthly columns → Month + Value format  

Used for:
- Normalizing data  
- Preparing data for analysis  
- Better compatibility with Pivot Tables and charts  

Very important for real-world datasets.
