# 📘 Excel – Phase 6 | Day 11  

## 📌 Topic: Charts & Data Visualization in Excel  

On Day 11, I learned how to **visualize data using Excel charts**. Charts help transform raw numbers into clear visual insights, making trends, comparisons, and distributions easier to understand for decision-making and reporting.

## 🔹 1) Column, Line, Bar & Pie Charts  

### ✅ Column Chart  
Used to compare values across categories.

Common use cases:
- Sales comparison  
- Monthly performance  
- Category-wise analysis  

---

### ✅ Line Chart  
Used to show trends over time.

Common use cases:
- Growth analysis  
- Time-series data  
- Performance tracking  

---

### ✅ Bar Chart  
Similar to column charts but displayed horizontally.

Used when:
- Category names are long  
- Comparing multiple items clearly  

---

Used to show proportional contribution of categories.

Used for:
- Percentage distribution  
- Share analysis  

Best practice:

## 🔹 2) Combo Chart  

Combo charts combine **two chart types in one visualization**.

Examples:
- Column + Line  
- Bar + Line  

Used when:
- Comparing two different metrics  
- One value needs secondary axis  

Common use case:
- Sales vs Profit  
- Revenue vs Growth

## 🔹 3) Waterfall, Sunburst & Treemap Charts  

### ✅ Waterfall Chart  
Shows how values increase or decrease step-by-step.

Used for:
- Profit and loss analysis  
- Budget tracking  
- Financial movement visualization  

---

### ✅ Sunburst Chart  
Displays hierarchical data in circular form.

Used for:
- Category → Subcategory analysis  
- Organizational structure  
- Hierarchical breakdown

### ✅ Treemap Chart  
Shows hierarchical data using rectangles.

Used for:
- Comparing part-to-whole relationships  
- Visualizing large hierarchical datasets
