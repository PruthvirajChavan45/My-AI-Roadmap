""".....Exception Handling......"""

#   - Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically
#       correct, but the code results in an error. this error does not 
#       stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the 
#       normal flow of the program.

#   - So you cannot handle the syntax error. but if there is no syntax error 
#      you can handle them.
