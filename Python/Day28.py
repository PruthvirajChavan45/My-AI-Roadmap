"""......Encapsulation......"""
#       - Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables)
#         and methods inside a class and restricting direct access from outside.

# In simple words:
#   - Hide the data and protect it.


"""......Access Modifiers......"""
#   1) Public
#   2) Protected
#   3) Private

"""......1) Public......"""
#   - Accessible from anywhere 
#   - Example : self.name

#   public variable : 
#       self.name = "Pruthviraj"


"""......2) Protected......"""
#  - Protected in python : 
#      - Written with one underscore: _variable
#      - Only a naming convention
#      - Not truly protected (can still be accessed)
#      - Tells developer: " internal use only "

#   public variable : 
#       self._salary = 50000
