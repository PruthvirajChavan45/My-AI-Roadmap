"""......Abstraction......"""
#   - Abstraction = Hiding unnecessary details and showing only what is needed.
#   - It allows the user to focus on what something does, not how it does it.

# Real-life example:
#   - You drive a car → you use steering, brake, accelerator
#   - You don't see engine internals
# This is abstraction.
