## 📌 Topics Covered:  
- Difference between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics 
- Introduction to Probability  
- Types of Events with Examples

## 📍 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics deals with **organizing, summarizing, and presenting data** in a meaningful way.  
It helps us understand **what the data shows**, without making predictions or conclusions beyond the given data.

Examples of descriptive statistics:
- Mean, Median, Mode  
- Range, Variance, Standard Deviation  
- Tables, Bar Graphs, Pie Charts, Histograms  

It answers questions like:
- What is the average value?  
- How is the data distributed?  

---

## 📍 Inferential Statistics  
Inferential statistics is used to **make predictions or conclusions about a population** based on a sample.  
It helps us go beyond the given data.

Examples of inferential statistics:
- Estimation  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Probability-based conclusions  

It answers questions like:
- What can we conclude about the population?  
- How confident are we about the result?

## 📍 Introduction to Probability  
Probability measures the **likelihood or chance of an event occurring**.  
Its value always lies between **0 and 1**.

```
Probability = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
```

- Probability = 0 → Event will not happen  
- Probability = 1 → Event will definitely happen

## 📍 Types of Events  

### 1️⃣ Independent Events  
Two events are independent if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other.

```
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

Example:
- Rolling a dice and flipping a coin  
- Getting a head does not affect the dice outcome  

---

### 2️⃣ Dependent Events  
Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one **affects** the probability of the other.

```
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
```

Example:
- Drawing two cards from a deck **without replacement**  
- The first draw changes the probability of the second  

---

### 3️⃣ Mutually Exclusive Events  
Two events are mutually exclusive if they **cannot occur at the same time**.

```
P(A ∩ B) = 0
```

Example:
- Rolling a dice and getting 3 or 6 in one throw  
- Only one outcome is possible at a time  

---

📌 **Summary:**  
Descriptive statistics explains data, inferential statistics predicts using data, probability measures uncertainty, and different types of events help us understand how events are related in probability experiments.
