# 📊 Statistics – Day 37  

## 📌 Topic: Measures of Central Tendency  
Today I learned the three main measures of central tendency: **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode**, along with the **types of Mode**.

## 📍 Mean (Average)  
Mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.  
It represents the *central value* of the dataset.  
```
Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Total number of observations)
```
Useful when data values vary smoothly and there are no extreme outliers.

---

## 📍 Median  
Median is the **middle value** when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.  
- If the number of values is odd → middle value  
- If even → average of the two middle values  

Median is best when data has outliers because it is not affected by extreme values.

## 📍 Mode  
Mode is the value that occurs **most frequently** in a dataset.  
It is useful for categorical data or when we want to know the most repeated observation.

---

## 📍 Types of Mode  
1. **No Mode** – when no value repeats  
2. **Unimodal** – when one value repeats the most  
3. **Bimodal** – when two values have the same highest frequency  
4. **Multimodal** – when more than two values repeat frequently  

Mode helps identify patterns or common categories in the data.
