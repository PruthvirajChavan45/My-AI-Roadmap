## 📍 Statistics Visualization & Data
Whenever we say **data**, we simply mean a **set of information**.  
This word “data” is powerful because it runs the world of:
- machine learning
- deep learning
- data mining  

➡️ **Data = Information**

---

## 📍 One-Way Table (Data Table)

### ✔ What is a data table?
- A tabular row & column representation of data  
- It has numbers of rows and columns  

Example:
Name | Age  
--- | ---
Pruthviraj | 22  
Vedant | 20  
Rohan | 18  
Akash | 24  

✔ Name = individual  
✔ Age = variable  

---

## 📍 Quantitative & Qualitative Variables

Example data table contains:
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Place  

🔹 Age → numeric values → **Quantitative variables**  
(continuous numeric data like age, salary, height)

🔹 Gender → M/F values → **Qualitative variables**  
(categorical data like gender)

## 📍 Bar Graph
A bar graph is a way of showing data using rectangular bars.  
We can use bar graphs to compare values such as salaries.

Example questions:
- What is the highest salary?
- What is the lowest salary?

Bar graph helps us answer these questions quickly by visualizing the counts.

---

## 📍 Pie Chart
A pie chart is a **circle divided into slices**.  
Each slice shows the **proportion** of a category out of the total.

Just like bar graph uses frequency count, pie chart also uses frequency count of a particular variable.

Example fruit counts → converted into percentages to draw pie slices.

## 📍 Line Graph
A line graph connects data points with a line so we can see:
- growth
- drop
- stability  

For making a line graph, we first think how we placed values on a bar graph, then put points and connect them, then remove bars.

Example use-case:
- monthly expenditure
- continuous data trend

---

## 📍 O-Gives
O-give is a graph of **cumulative frequency**.

It tells you:
- how many values are **up to** a point (less-than ogive)
- how many values are **at least** a point (more-than ogive)
