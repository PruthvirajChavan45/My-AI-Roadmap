## 📌 Topic: Data Distribution

## 📍 Data Distribution  
Data distribution describes **how data values are spread or arranged** across different values.  
It helps us understand the pattern, center, and variability of the data.

---

## 📍 Types of Distribution  
1. **Normal Distribution** – Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve where mean, median, and mode are equal.  
2. **Right-Skewed Distribution** – Tail extends to the right; mean is greater than median.  
3. **Left-Skewed Distribution** – Tail extends to the left; mean is less than median.  
4. **Uniform Distribution** – All values have equal frequency.

## 📍 Notations  
- μ (mu) → Population mean  
- σ (sigma) → Population standard deviation  
- σ² → Population variance  
- x̄ (x-bar) → Sample mean  
- s → Sample standard deviation  
- n → Number of observations  

---

## 📍 Mean  
Mean represents the **average value** of the data.  
```
Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Total number of observations)
```

---

## 📍 Variance  
Variance measures how far each value is from the mean.  
It is the average of the squared differences from the mean.  
```
Variance = Σ(x − mean)² / n
```

---

## 📍 Standard Deviation  
Standard deviation is the **square root of variance**.  
It shows how much data typically deviates from the mean.  
```
Standard Deviation = √Variance
```

---

## 📍 Use Case of Standard Deviation  
- Measures **data consistency**  
- Small standard deviation → data clustered near the mean  
- Large standard deviation → data widely spread  
- Used in finance (risk analysis), quality control, exams, and machine learning  
- Helps compare variability between different datasets
