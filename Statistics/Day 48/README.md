# 📊 Statistics – Day 48

## 📌 Topic: Z-Test (Hypothesis Testing)

The **Z-Test** is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a known or claimed population mean.

---

## 📍 When to Use Z-Test
- Population standard deviation (σ) is **known**
- Sample size is **large (n ≥ 30)**
- Data is approximately **normally distributed**
- Used for testing **mean-related hypotheses**

---

## 📍 Z-Test Formula

Z = ( x̄ − μ₀ ) / ( σ / √n )

Where:
- x̄ = Sample mean  
- μ₀ = Population (claimed) mean  
- σ = Population standard deviation  
- n = Sample size  

---

## 📍 Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: μ = μ₀ (no difference)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:
  - μ ≠ μ₀ (two-tailed test)
  - μ > μ₀ (right-tailed test)
  - μ < μ₀ (left-tailed test)

---

## 📍 Significance Level (α)
- Common values: **0.05 (5%)**, **0.01 (1%)**
- It represents the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis

---

## 📍 Critical Z-Values (α = 0.05)
- Two-tailed test → **±1.96**
- One-tailed test → **±1.645**

---

## 📍 Decision Rule
- If |Z calculated| > Z critical → **Reject H₀**
- If |Z calculated| ≤ Z critical → **Fail to reject H₀**

---

## 📍 Interpretation
- Z value tells how many **standard deviations** the sample mean is away from the population mean
- Larger |Z| → stronger evidence against H₀

---

## 📍 Conclusion
The Z-Test helps decide whether observed differences are due to **random chance** or are **statistically significant**, making it a key tool in data analysis and decision-making.
