## 📌 Topic: Bayes’ Theorem  

Bayes’ Theorem is a rule in probability that helps us **update the probability of an event when new information (evidence) is available**.  
It tells us how our belief about an event should change after seeing related data.

## 📍 Bayes’ Theorem Formula  

```
P(A | B) = [ P(B | A) × P(A) ] / P(B)
```

Where:  
- **P(A | B)** → Probability of event A given that B has occurred (posterior probability)  
- **P(B | A)** → Probability of event B given that A has occurred (likelihood)  
- **P(A)** → Initial probability of event A (prior probability)  
- **P(B)** → Probability of event B (evidence)

## 📍 Meaning of Bayes’ Theorem  
- It starts with an initial belief (prior)  
- Uses new evidence to adjust that belief  
- Produces an updated probability (posterior)  
- Helps in making better decisions based on data  

---

## 📍 Simple Understanding  
Bayes’ Theorem combines **intuition + evidence**.  
As more evidence is available, the probability becomes more accurate.
