# 📘 Pandas – Day 9  

## 📌 Topic: Complete Pandas Revision & Concept Consolidation  

Day 9 was dedicated to **revising and consolidating all major Pandas concepts** learned so far.  
The goal of this revision was to strengthen fundamentals, improve confidence, and ensure a clear understanding of how different Pandas features connect in real-world data analysis workflows.

This session focused on **recap, clarity, and correctness**, rather than learning new APIs.

## 🔁 Topics Revised (High-Level Overview)

### 🔹 Core Pandas Foundations
- Understanding Pandas use cases in data analysis  
- Series vs DataFrame  
- Creating DataFrames from lists, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, CSV/Excel  

---

### 🔹 Data Inspection & Understanding
- `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`  
- `shape`, `dtypes`, memory awareness  
- Index and columns overview  

---

### 🔹 Data Selection & Filtering
- Column and row selection  
- Boolean indexing & conditional filtering  
- Multiple conditions using `&`, `|`, `~`  
- Cleaner filtering using `query()`  
- String operations using `.str` accessor  

---

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (`isna`, `dropna`, `fillna`)  
- Changing data types (`astype`)  
- Replacing incorrect values (`replace`)  
- Dropping rows and columns (`drop`)  
- Detecting and removing duplicates  

---

### 🔹 Sorting & Basic Statistics
- Sorting using `sort_values()` and `sort_index()`  
- Descriptive statistics (`mean`, `median`, `mode`, `std`)  
- Statistical summary using `describe()`  
- Counting categorical values using `value_counts()`  
- Correlation and covariance analysis  

---

### 🔹 GroupBy & Aggregations
- Split–Apply–Combine concept  
- Aggregations using `sum`, `mean`, `count`, `min`, `max`  
- Multiple aggregations with `agg()`  
- Pivot tables for summarization  
- Crosstab for categorical comparison  

---

### 🔹 Merging, Joining & Concatenation
- Combining data using `concat()`  
- SQL-style joins using `merge()`  
- Index-based joins using `join()`  
- Understanding join types and missing values after joins  

---

### 🔹 Time Series & Advanced Usage
- Converting columns to datetime  
- Setting DateTime index  
- Resampling data (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)  
- Applying custom functions using `apply()`  
- Element-wise transformations using `map()`  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways from Day 9

- Reinforced core Pandas concepts  
- Improved clarity on when to use specific methods  
- Connected individual topics into a complete workflow  
- Strengthened readiness for real-world datasets  
- Built confidence for interviews and projects  
- Prepared a strong base for advanced analysis and visualization  

---

## 🎯 Outcome  

Day 9 helped transform **individual Pandas concepts into a unified skillset**.  
This revision ensures I can confidently:
- Clean and preprocess data  
- Analyze and summarize datasets  
- Combine multiple data sources  
- Work efficiently with real-world data
