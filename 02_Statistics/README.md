# 📊 Statistics for Data Analysis

This folder contains my structured learning journey in **Statistics for Data Analysis**, organized module-wise instead of day-wise to reflect a professional and industry-standard learning approach.

The goal of this section is to build **strong statistical foundations** required for:
- Data Analysis
- Business Analytics
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
