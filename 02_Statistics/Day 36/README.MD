## 📍 Two-Way Table  
A two-way table shows the relationship between **two categorical variables**.  
It helps us compare how two variables interact by displaying counts for each category pair.

Example: Gender vs. Preferred Sport  
Rows represent one variable, columns represent another.

## 📍 Dot Plot  
A dot plot displays **individual data points** on a number line.  
Each dot represents one value.  
It is useful for small data sets to quickly see:
- clusters  
- gaps  
- highest & lowest values  

---

## 📍 Relative Frequency Table  
A relative frequency table shows the **proportion or percentage** of each category instead of raw counts.  
Formula:  
```
Relative Frequency = (Category Count / Total Count)
```  
It helps compare categories even when sample sizes are different.

---

## 📍 Joint Distribution  
Joint distribution shows the **probability or proportion** of outcomes across two variables in a two-way table.  
It describes how often combinations of two variables occur.  
```
Joint Distribution = (Cell Count / Total Observations)
```

---

## 📍 Histogram  
A histogram is used for **numerical data**.  
It groups values into **bins (intervals)** and uses bars to show how many values fall in each bin.  
Unlike a bar graph, the bars **touch each other** because the data is continuous.  
It helps identify:
- shape of distribution  
- peaks  
- spread  
- outliers
