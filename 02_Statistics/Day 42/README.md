## 📌 Topic: Z-Score (Standard Score)  

---

## 📍 Z-Score  
A Z-score tells us **how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean**.  
It helps us understand the **relative position** of a value within a data distribution.

---

## 📍 Z-Score Formula  
```
Z = (X − μ) / σ
```
Where:  
- X = data point  
- μ = mean  
- σ = standard deviation  

---

## 📍 Meaning of Z-Score  
- Z = 0 → value is exactly at the mean  
- Z > 0 → value is above the mean  
- Z < 0 → value is below the mean  
- Larger |Z| → value is farther from the mean  

---

## 📍 Example  
If mean = 8 and standard deviation = 1,  
and data point X = 9.5  

```
Z = (9.5 − 8) / 1 = 1.5
```

This means the value 9.5 is **1.5 standard deviations above the mean**.

---

## 📍 Z-Table & Percentage  
Z-score can be used to find the **percentage of data below or above a given value** using a Z-table.

For Z = 1.50,  
Z-table value ≈ 0.93319  

```
0.93319 × 100 = 93.31%
```

So, **93.31% of the data lies below this data point**.

## 📍 Use Case of Z-Score  
- Compare values from different datasets  
- Identify outliers  
- Find probabilities and percentages  
- Used in exams, data analysis, and machine learning  
- Helps standardize data for fair comparison
