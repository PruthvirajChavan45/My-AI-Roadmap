## 📍 Density Curve  
A density curve is a **smooth curve** that shows the overall shape of a data distribution.  
Instead of focusing on individual bars like a histogram, a density curve gives a **clear and continuous picture** of how data is distributed.

To understand a density curve:
- We first start with a **histogram**
- Plot points on the top of histogram bars
- Connect those points to form a **frequency polygon**
- Smooth the sharp edges of the polygon to get a **density curve**

Key points about density curve:
- It represents **continuous data**
- The **total area under the curve is always 100% (or 1)**
- The area under any section of the curve represents the **percentage of data** in that range
- It helps visualize data pattern, center, and spread clearly

## 📍 Empirical Rule  
The empirical rule applies to a **normal distribution (bell-shaped curve)**.  
In a normal distribution:
- The mean lies at the center
- 50% of data lies on the left of the mean
- 50% of data lies on the right of the mean

Empirical Rule states:
- About **68%** of the data lies within **1 standard deviation (μ ± 1σ)**
- About **95%** of the data lies within **2 standard deviations (μ ± 2σ)**
- About **99.7%** of the data lies within **3 standard deviations (μ ± 3σ)**

These divisions help us understand how data spreads around the mean and are widely used in data analysis and real-world interpretations.
